# Rusty Journal

-> Small Rust project at the end of the **Azure Learning Rust course**.

## What it can do:

- Add new task to the list (create file if necessary)
- Remove completed tasks from the list
- Display the list
- Support of different list files

## Currently working on (ToDo):

1. Fixing the friendly error displaying mechanism
2. Maybe add other functions
